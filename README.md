# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic: Predicting Passenger Transport

Welcome aboard! This project is my attempt at solving Kaggle’s [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) machine learning challenge. The objective? Predict whether passengers were transported to another dimension based on onboard details.

---

## 📌 Overview

The year is 2912. A spaceship carrying thousands of passengers through space mysteriously disappears. Given passenger and travel details, our task is to train a model that predicts who was transported during this cosmic event.

This project explores:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Handling missing values smartly
- Feature engineering
- Building machine learning models
- Preparing a valid Kaggle submission

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

This competition was a fun way to work with science-fiction-themed data, but more importantly, it provided an opportunity to practice real ML workflows end to end. From raw CSVs to a polished `.csv` submission, I built a complete pipeline here.
